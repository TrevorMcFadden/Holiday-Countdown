# Holiday Countdown
<b>"For there is born to you today, in Davidâ€™s city, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord" (Luke 2:11, WEB).</b>
<br>
Have you ever wanted to see when a major holiday was and how many days away it is? Try Holiday Countdown. Holiday Countdown is an open-source holiday countdown developed in Windows Forms to help you know when and how many days away a certain holiday is.
<br>
<br>
Features:
- Holiday Countdown features three important holidays (Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas) and two fun holidays (New Year's Eve and New Year's Day).
- Holiday Countdown is designed in a MDI (multi-document interface), allowing you to view the holiday countdowns as multiple windows within the application.
